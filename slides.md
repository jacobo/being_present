## Although instinct isn't the right word, something like it, along with a clear mind, work better than thinking because, at the Pipe, there isn't enough time for thought.
## A Zen-like mind that is empty of thoughts allows a strong connection with the wave.
## It lets the surfer be in touch with the wave as opposed to being apart from it.
--- Gerry Lopez

## Anytime I go surfing can be a religious experience if I let it. It is a close encounter with one of our world's greatest natural wonders.
## Out here on the edge of the known world, far from the distractions of civilization, I can more easily find this space.
## But in reality any of us can find it anywhere, because we carry it inside us everywhere we go.

# Ed

.notes I knew him as "Director of engineering". Opened my eyes to surfing new places, exploring. Surfing in the winter. Trying new boards One of the first time's Ed and I surfed together I can only recently started at Brontes.  He asked me "How are things"? I said "which, work? or surf?" He replied, oh well surf I guess. Clearly you understand what's more important.
.notes It's critical to always mix work and surfing. The yellow board, a big hull shaped by Ryan Lovelace, was picked up while I was in LA, repairing COSs and meeting customers. I rode it at Ricon, County Line, Topanga Canyon and Cardiff Reef. In between each session, I repaired a COS. It's more complicated than sending a tech or paying shipping on a new board, but, that's far less satisfying.

## Such is the life we can know.
## Living in the past and in the future - in recollection and in anticipation - creates a less clear picture of the present.
## By being in the here and now we understand that the past and future only exist in the present.
--- Gerry Lopez

.notes quote by Gerry Lopez. He was talking about his experience big wave surfing. Fortunately for me, I can get this feeling from less life-threatening situations.
